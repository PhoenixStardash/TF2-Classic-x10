# ‚ùî FAQ
### Q: How did you edit the CTX files, aren't they encrypted?
### A: Yes they are encrypted, we used a tool called VICE to decrypt the CTX files in order to modify them and re-encrypt them.

### Q: Does this support only servers, or can you install them to your normal game?
### A: For the most part, yes. But they will be overridden if the server doesn't have the mod installed.

### Q: Can these be used in the live version of TF2?
### A: Probably not, there are probably differences with Old TF2 vs Live TF2. Use sourcemod plugins or VScript to achieve the same effect.

### Q: Can you port this mod to Live TF2?
### A: No, sorry.
