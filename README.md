# ‚ùî FAQ
### How did you edit the CTX files, aren't they encrypted?
Yes they are encrypted, we used a tool called VICE to decrypt the CTX files in order to modify them and re-encrypt them.

### Does this support only servers, or can you install them to your normal game?
For the most part, yes. But they will be overridden if the server doesn't have the mod installed.

### Can these be used in the live version of TF2?
Probably not, there are probably differences with Old TF2 vs Live TF2. Use sourcemod plugins or VScript to achieve the same effect.

### Can you port this mod to Live TF2?
No, sorry. Use the sourcemod plugin.

### Why arent you working on this anymore?
Please read above for the reason why I won't be working on it anymore.
